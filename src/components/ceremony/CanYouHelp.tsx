        This is very much a DIY wedding so if you can help us at all we'd really
        appreciate it (though no pressure at all!).
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We are growing lots of flowers to decorate the venue, but the more the
        merrier, so if you can grow any and bring them along that would be
        amazing! The colour scheme is burnt orange, sunflower yellow, dark green
        and hot pink. Bou has put together a list of possible flowers to grow.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The space is massive so if you happen to have anything lying around that
        could potentially be used to decorate the venue or outdoor areas, they
        would also be appreciated, as would any big games we could borrow
        (things like giant Jenga or massive connect 4).
